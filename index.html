                Hi, I'm Dillon Alexander, and this is my "Hello World!" for WDD 130. I'm from Colorado, and I'm in this class because I need the credit to finish off my general electives. I am close to finishing off my Bachelor's degree in Applied Technology in a few semesters. I am planning on going into in-house IT for a long term career. I am starting to learn blender in order to get into modding games as well. One of my favorite books that I have read is called the Toaster project written by Thomas Thwaites.   The Toaster Project by Thomas Thwaites is a fascinating endeavor that highlights the complex global supply chains involved in creating seemingly mundane products. Thwaites set out to build a toaster entirely from scratch, using pre-industrial tools and methods. His journey involved collecting raw materials, smelting iron ore, and even distilling crude plastic from oil. The resulting “half-baked, handmade pastiche” of a toaster contrasts sharply with the inexpensive ones we buy today.
